# Hospital-management-system
Table Name is hospital_system in the Mysql
The Program is connected with the mysql we can register a user and after succesful registration of the user 
we can use his credential to login with his/her registered information.
This is a eclipse program and it will only assume new registraion or we can say it will give the same results until we delete the program under the tomcat running 
folder present near the console. Then we rerun the program.
